# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

For this assignment I was instructed to develop a small quiz using mainly Javascript in order to dynamically update HTML. It was through this that I was able to hide and reveal aspects of my HTML page by setting attributes found in my CSS file. By then looping through questions and collecting information on the user's answers, I was able to penalize and calculate a final score using the timer that I placed in the file. Then by using a secondary html page and the local storage, I was able to present the user with a history of their scores, as well as document which of them was their highest score. By doing this, I have met all the criteria that was placed before me, which I will include in the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria. 

## Given: User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Given: Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the Start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
